[POW](/readelse.md)
Clone this repo onto your local machine and you will be ready to code up a full stack Hyperloop app.  You will need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and the [Mysql database server]  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html) installed.  

You can also clone the repo into a [Cloud9 virtual IDE](https://c9.io) workspace for an even quicker install ([details here.](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/rails-clone-and-go/blob/master/cloud9-setup.md))

Once you have cloned the repo (or created your Cloud9 workspace) run `bin/setup` in a console window.

You will need to run `rvm use 2.3.1` after setup completes to switch the Ruby 2.3.1.

Once you are installed you can fire up the server and the opal-hot-reloader by running `bin/hyperloop` in a console window (in Cloud9 you can also use the run command at the top navbar.)  Note that it will take several minutes to precompile the hyperloop client libraries on the first boot.

Once your server is booted visit your newly created Application's home page and you should see a welcome message.  On Cloud9 you can use the preview button (in the top navbar) to bring up your app right in the IDE, which works very well with the hot-reloader.

## Hyperloop Quick Start

#### Adding a more Components:

`bundle exec rails g hyper:component Hello` will add a `Hello` component template and place it in the `app/hyperloop/components` directory.  Details on the structure of Hyperloop components can be found [here.](http://ruby-hyperloop.io/docs/components/dsl-overview/)

#### Routing to other components:

The repo already routes everything to a top level `App` component using this route:

`get '/(*other)', to: 'hyperloop#app'`

To have your application respond to different routes and display different components you will add more routes to the `App` component.  See the [hyper-router gem](https://github.com/ruby-hyperloop/hyper-router) for more info.

#### Models

Create new models like you normally would in rails, and then move your rails models to the `app/hyperloop/models` directory to make them accessible to the client.  Access permissions are controlled by policies found in the `app/policies` directory.  More info on Hyperloop models [here.](http://ruby-hyperloop.io/start/models/)

#### Stores

Complex reactive state information should be kept in stores, which should be placed in the `app/hyperloop/stores` directory.  More info on Stores [here.](http://ruby-hyperloop.io/start/stores/)

#### Operations

Hyperloop Operations keep Stores and Components separated, provides a central place to put business logic, and can run isomorphically on the client or server.  More info on Operations [here.](http://ruby-hyperloop.io/start/operations/)

#### Have Fun!
